## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

Anzii is built with performance as a priority, implementing modern optimization techniques for fast loading and smooth user experience.

### Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

All major page sections use dynamic imports and code splitting to reduce initial bundle size:

```typescript
// Components are lazily loaded with loading states
const PricingCards = dynamic(
	() => import("@/components/sections/pricing/pricing-cards"),
	{
		loading: () => <LoadingSkeleton variant="cards" />,
		ssr: false, // Client-side only for interactive components
	}
);
```

**Implemented on:**

- ‚úÖ **Home page** - Hero, How it Works, Testimonials, CTA sections
- ‚úÖ **Features page** - Hero, Core Features, In Action sections
- ‚úÖ **Pricing page** - Hero, Pricing Cards, FAQ sections
- ‚úÖ **Roadmap page** - Hero, Timeline sections

### Loading States & Skeletons

Custom loading skeletons provide smooth transitions during component loading:

```typescript
<LoadingSkeleton variant="cards" />     // For pricing cards, testimonials
<LoadingSkeleton variant="timeline" />  // For roadmap timeline
<LoadingSkeleton variant="hero" />      // For hero sections
<LoadingSkeleton variant="features" />  // For feature grids
<LoadingSkeleton variant="faq" />       // For FAQ sections
```

### Image Optimization

Lazy loading images with Next.js optimization and custom loading states:

```typescript
<LazyImage
	src="/hero-image.jpg"
	alt="Hero image"
	width={800}
	height={600}
	priority={false}        // Lazy load by default
	quality={75}           // Optimized quality
	placeholder="blur"     // Blur placeholder while loading
/>
```

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Automatic WebP conversion** via Next.js Image optimization
- ‚úÖ **Responsive sizing** with optimized srcsets
- ‚úÖ **Blur placeholders** during loading
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** with fallback UI
- ‚úÖ **Loading shimmer animations**

### Performance Monitoring

Built-in performance tracking to monitor Core Web Vitals and lazy loading efficiency:

```typescript
import { trackComponentLoad, getPerformanceInsights } from "@/lib/performance";

// Track component loading time
const endTracking = trackComponentLoad("PricingCards");
// Component loads...
endTracking();

// Get performance insights
const insights = getPerformanceInsights();
// ["‚úÖ LCP performance is good!", "‚úÖ Lazy loading performance is excellent!"]
```

**Tracked Metrics:**

- üéØ **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- üéØ **FID** (First Input Delay)
- üéØ **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- üìä **Component load times**
- üìä **Lazy loading success rates**
- üìä **Image loading performance**

### Bundle Optimization

	FEATURES: "/features",
	PRICING: "/pricing",
	ROADMAP: "/roadmap",

	// Auth routes
	SIGN_IN: "/sign-in",
	SIGN_UP: "/sign-up",
	SETTINGS: "/settings",

	// Authenticated routes
	DASHBOARD: "/dashboard",
	CREATE: "/create",

	// Dynamic routes
	DECK: (deckId: string) => `/deck/${deckId}`,
} as const;
```

**Benefits:**

- **Single Source of Truth**: All routes defined in one place
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures route consistency
- **Easy Refactoring**: Change routes globally by updating the configuration
- **Developer Experience**: Autocomplete and IDE support for all routes

## üß† Research Methodology

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm Implementation

The core of Anzii's effectiveness lies in its implementation of Hermann Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve theory, operationalized through the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Card Review] --> B{Performance Rating}
    B -->|Easy 5| C[EF += 0.15<br/>Interval *= 2.5]
    B -->|Good 4| D[EF += 0.13<br/>Interval *= 2]
    B -->|Medium 3| E[EF unchanged<br/>Interval *= 1.3]
    B -->|Hard 2| F[EF -= 0.15<br/>Interval = 1 day]
    B -->|Again 1| G[EF -= 0.2<br/>Reset to start]

    C --> H[Schedule Next Review]
    D --> H
    E --> H
    F --> H
    G --> H

    H --> I[Next Review Date = <br/>Current Date + Interval]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe

	card.easeFactor + (0.1 - (5 - rating) * (0.08 + (5 - rating) * 0.02))
);

// Interval progression with exponential growth
const newInterval = rating >= 3 ? Math.ceil(card.interval * newEaseFactor) : 1; // Reset on failure
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Processing**: Batch API requests for optimal sync performance
- **Debounced Updates**: 1-second delay prevents excessive server calls
- **Optimistic Updates**: Zero-latency user feedback during reviews

### Component Architecture

The component system follows a clean architecture pattern with strict adherence to coding standards:

#### Clean Code Principles

- **Size Limit**: Components do not exceed 50 lines of code
- **Props Limit**: Components have maximum 3 props for simplicity
- **Nesting Limit**: JSX nesting does not exceed 3 levels deep
- **State Management**: Multiple useState calls use custom hooks or useReducer

#### Component Organization

- **UI Components** (`/ui`): Base shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- **Layout Components** (`/layout`): Navigation, headers, and page structure
- **Section Components** (`/sections`): Large page sections like landing pages
- **Feature Components** (`/features`): Grouped by domain (AI, deck management, study)
- **Common Components** (`/common`): Shared utilities across features

#### Landing Page Architecture

The landing page has been refactored into modular components for maintainability:

```
src/components/sections/landing/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hero-section.tsx          # Hero with CTA
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stats-section.tsx         # Trust indicators
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services-section.tsx      # Feature highlights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cta-section.tsx          # Call-to-action
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process-section.tsx      # How it works
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-section.tsx         # Team showcase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testimonials-section.tsx # Social proof
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                 # Barrel exports
```

**Supporting Files:**

- `src/data/landing-data.ts` - Static data extraction
- `src/hooks/useLandingPageState.ts` - State management hook

This modular approach enables:

- **Reusability**: Components can be used across different pages
- **Testability**: Individual sections can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update specific sections
- **Performance**: Better code splitting and loading

1. **AI Generation**: Input topics ‚Üí AI creates comprehensive decks
2. **Markdown Import**: Paste notes ‚Üí AI extracts key concepts
3. **Manual Creation**: Traditional question-answer pair entry
4. **JSON Import**: Bulk import from external systems

### Study Sessions

- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Only due cards appear for review
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate UI response to user interactions
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators show learning momentum
- **Manual Session Control**: Users remain on completion screen and manually choose when to return to dashboard

### Customization

- **Theme Selection**: Choose from 17 carefully crafted color schemes
- **Deck Management**: Organize, rename, and reset progress as needed

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dependency Override Conflicts

**Error Message:**

```
npm ERR! code EOVERRIDE
npm ERR! Override for @radix-ui/react-slot@^X.X.X conflicts with direct dependency
```

**Cause:** Package overrides can conflict with direct dependencies when versions don't align.

**Solution:** Remove conflicting overrides and clean reinstall:

```bash
# Remove the overrides section from package.json if it conflicts
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

**Prevention:** Only use package overrides when absolutely necessary for compatibility issues. Modern Radix UI packages generally work well together without overrides.

#### Deck Reset Loading State

**Feature:** When users restart deck learning progress, a loading indicator is shown on the restart button to provide immediate feedback.

**Implementation Details:**

- The restart button shows a spinning loader icon and "Restarting..." text during the reset operation
- The button is disabled only during the reset process to prevent multiple operations
- Loading state is tracked per-deck, allowing users to interact with other decks while one is being reset
- Toast notifications confirm successful reset or display error messages
- **Fixed Issue**: Restart button now works correctly when all cards are due for review (e.g., 16/16 cards due)
- Simplified logic ensures restart button is only disabled during active reset operations

**User Experience:**

1. User clicks "Restart" button on a deck
2. Confirmation dialog appears asking to confirm the reset
3. Upon confirmation, button shows loading spinner and "Restarting..." text
4. Button is disabled until the operation completes
5. Success/error toast message appears
6. Button returns to normal state and deck list refreshes

**Process Flow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant DeckList as "DeckList Component"
    participant Hook as "useDeckManagement Hook"
    participant Action as "resetDeckProgress Action"
    participant Database

    User->>DeckList: Click "Restart" button
    DeckList->>User: Show confirmation dialog
    User->>DeckList: Confirm reset
    DeckList->>Hook: Call handleResetDeck(deckId)
    Hook->>Hook: Set resetLoadingDeckId = deckId
    Hook->>DeckList: Update loading state
    DeckList->>User: Show "Restarting..." with spinner
    Hook->>Action: Call resetDeckProgress(deckId)
    Action->>Database: Reset all cards in deck
    Database->>Action: Return success/error result
    Action->>Hook: Return result
    Hook->>Hook: Set resetLoadingDeckId = null
    Hook->>DeckList: Clear loading state
    Hook->>User: Show toast notification
    DeckList->>User: Button returns to normal state
```

### Component Architecture

The component system follows a clean architecture pattern with strict adherence to coding standards:

#### Clean Code Principles

- **Size Limit**: Components do not exceed 50 lines of code
- **Props Limit**: Components have maximum 3 props for simplicity
- **Nesting Limit**: JSX nesting does not exceed 3 levels deep
- **State Management**: Multiple useState calls use custom hooks or useReducer

#### Component Organization

- **UI Components** (`/ui`): Base shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- **Layout Components** (`/layout`): Navigation, headers, and page structure
- **Section Components** (`/sections`): Large page sections like landing pages
- **Feature Components** (`/features`): Grouped by domain (AI, deck management, study)
- **Common Components** (`/common`): Shared utilities across features

#### Landing Page Architecture

The landing page has been refactored into modular components for maintainability:

```
src/components/sections/landing/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hero-section.tsx          # Hero with CTA
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stats-section.tsx         # Trust indicators
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services-section.tsx      # Feature highlights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cta-section.tsx          # Call-to-action
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process-section.tsx      # How it works
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team-section.tsx         # Team showcase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testimonials-section.tsx # Social proof
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                 # Barrel exports
```

**Supporting Files:**

- `src/data/landing-data.ts` - Static data extraction
- `src/hooks/useLandingPageState.ts` - State management hook

This modular approach enables:

- **Reusability**: Components can be used across different pages
- **Testability**: Individual sections can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update specific sections
- **Performance**: Better code splitting and loading

### Routing Structure

The application uses Next.js 13+ App Router with the following routes:

- `/` - Landing page with marketing content
- `/dashboard` - Main application dashboard (requires authentication)
- `/about-us` - Company information, team, mission, and values
- `/features` - Detailed feature descriptions and comparisons
- `/pricing` - Pricing plans with annual/monthly toggle
- `/roadmap` - Product development roadmap and upcoming features
- `/create` - Deck creation interface
- `/deck/[deckId]` - Study session for specific deck
- `/sign-in` - Authentication sign in
- `/sign-up` - Authentication sign up

### Theme System

The application features a unified design system with:

- **Color Scheme**: Black background with lime green (`#a3e635`) accents
- **Typography**: Responsive text sizing with mobile-first approach
- **Components**: Consistent card styling with rounded corners and shadow effects
- **Theme Integration**: Next-themes integration with Stack Auth theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)

All pages follow the same design language for a cohesive user experience.

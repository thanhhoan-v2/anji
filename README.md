## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (or [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for cloud)
- [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/) for AI features

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anzii.git
   cd anzii
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Configure your `.env.local`:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host/database"
   GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:migrate
   pnpm db:seed  # Optional: Add sample data
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

6. **Run tests** (Optional)

   ```bash
   # Unit tests
   pnpm test

   # E2E tests
   pnpm test:e2e

   # All tests
   pnpm test:all
   ```

## Use Cases

- **Medical students** preparing for boards with AI-generated question banks
- **Software engineers** learning new technologies through documentation conversion
- **Language learners** building vocabulary with spaced repetition
- **Professionals** pursuing certifications with progress tracking
- **Researchers** organizing knowledge from academic papers
